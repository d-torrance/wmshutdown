1. What is wmShutdown?

	wmShutdown is a Window Maker dock application that allows you to shutdown or reboot your machine just by clickig a button on your desktop.
	It's useful just for desktop machines, so there's no need to keep typing shutdown now -h every time you have to go away for some reason.

	I'd be thankful for any fixes or comments about it.

2. Security issues

	As we have to shutdown a machine as a single user, there are some trick that must be remembered here.

	-There are two binaries:
		wmshutdown: The dock itself, because GTK apps can't be suid
		wmshutdown-run: suid program called by wmShutdown just to call /sbin/shutdown

	As this was created for workstations, probably there's not much to be afraid.

3. Install/Uninstall

	tar -zxvf wmshutdown-1.0.tar.gz
	cd wmshutdown-1.0
	./configure
	make
	make install [as root]


4. License

	wmShutdown is under GPL.
